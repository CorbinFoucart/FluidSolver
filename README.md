FluidSolver
===========

Implemented in Matlab

Time dependent, coupled Solver that uses Finite Volume method to solve convection-diffusion equation and uses a 
Finite Element Method to solve the Stokes Equation. The system models Rayleigh-Bernard convection 
(Bousinesq approximation). 

Mesh files are large, so only small or demonstrative meshes are uploaded. Within the files are matlab scripts that 
can generate the meshes and save them.

COMING SOON: Latex Files to match the relevant malab files.

This project began as an internship with the Weierstrass Institut in Berlin under the direction of 
Dr. Alexander Linke.
